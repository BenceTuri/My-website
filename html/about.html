    <p class="maintext" id="start">My name is Turi Bence, I born in 2008, December 19. <br>
    I've started coding in 2021 winter, with HTML. It was amazing seeing what could I do 100% percent from scratch. <br>
    Unfortunately, I quickly quit programming, until I saw code basycally everywhere. YouTubers making games started to show up, and I wathed them a ton. <br>
    It was pretty cool seeing ideas come to life, so I tried, failed. <br>
    I didn't actually understood what the code was doing, I just wrote it. I wasn't a programmer, but a copyer.<br>
    Now, because of age and probably math problems, I understand the code, and know how to do it. <br>
    Currently, the languages I use are the three web-dev languages(HTML, CSS, JavaScript), C# for apps and Unity and python for basic programming. I also use GDscript, wich is a language built-in to the Godot game engine.
